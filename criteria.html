      <h1>Criteria</h1>
  	  <p class="text-justify">In order to establish the criteria that our comparison tool works with, we first created an evaluation model. We looked into meta analytical studies of website evaluation approaches. The studies analysed websites evaluation parameters based on user interaction between 1995 and 2011. We then grouped all the results from the studies that focused on commercial, educational and shopping websites, as these share more features with the core functions of a comparison website. The criteria we selected through this vetting process can be seen in the table below.</p>

      <table>
        <thead><tr><th>Criteria</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
           <tr><td>UI</td><td>Evaluates how the UI of the relevant app performs in terms of eye strain, simplicity and cluttering.</td></tr>
           <tr><td>Ease of Use</td><td>Evaluates how how quickly the app can be learnt and mastered and if there are any help topics to make a user's experience easier.</td></tr>
           <tr><td>Mobile Integration</td><td>Evaluates how well the app performs across multiple platforms.</td></tr>
           <tr><td>Cost/Payment Plans</td><td>Evaluates how a app service can be paid for (weekly, monthly, yearly) and what payment options are available.</td></tr>
           <tr><td>Content Management</td><td>Evaluates what type of data the app can output and how compatible they are with generic data analysis tools.</td></tr>
           <tr><td>Security/Ethics</td><td>Evaluates how user data is handled, what level of data security if offered and what legal ties are present in a subscription to the app.</td></tr>
           <tr><td>Customer Support</td><td>Evaluates the customer support offered by the app.</td></tr>
           <tr><td>Terms and Conditions</td><td>Evaluates what is hidden in the terms & conditions of the app.</td></tr>
           <tr><td>Core Features</td><td>Evaluates the wealth and depth of the features that the app offers.</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p class="text-justify">To ensure that both features and functionality were assessed in each Twitter analytic tool, we devised a 5 question assessment evaluation form. 5 question were devised for each criteria to ensure equal weighting. The questions were written to guarantee a factual yes/no result. Each tool was then assessed and scored independently by four different users, to ensure that each question was answered correctly. The scores were then normalized. You can see the evaluation form below.</p>
